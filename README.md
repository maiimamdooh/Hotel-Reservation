## Hotal Reservation Analysis Using SQL 
In the "Hotel Reservation" project, I utilized SQL to clean and validate the dataset, ensuring data accuracy and consistency. After the data preparation phase, I conducted business analysis to extract valuable insights, addressing key questions such as:

- Comparing revenue between holidays and regular days.
- Assessing the impact of promotional offers on earnings.
- Analyzing booking duration and cancellation rates.
- Calculating the overall cancellation rate.
- Examining the percentage of returning guests.
- Determining total revenue on weekdays vs. weekends.
- Identifying total bookings and revenue per room type.
